# ESPHome LED Control Project

This project demonstrates how to use ESPHome to control a basic LED with an ESP32-based microcontroller. By using this project, you can learn how to create basic IoT devices with ESP32 and ESPHome.

## Requirements

- An ESP32-based development board (e.g., NodeMCU-32S)
- Arduino IDE or a similar software
- Access to a Wi-Fi network

## Installation

1. Clone this project to your computer or download and extract the ZIP file.

2. Install ESPHome using the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install esphome
   ```

3. Update your Wi-Fi connection and password in the ESPHome configuration file:

   ```yaml
   wifi:
     ssid: "WiFi_SSID"
     password: "WiFi_PASSWORD"
   ```

4. Open the configuration file by using a text editor and edit `my_project_name.yaml`. Customize the GPIO pin and other settings as needed.

5. Use the following command to upload the configuration file to your ESP32:

   ```bash
   esphome my_project_name.yaml run
   ```

6. Your ESP32 is now ready to control the LED.

## Usage

- You can control the LED by using a home automation platform (e.g., Home Assistant). ESPHome provides a service to control the LED.

- To turn on the LED:

  ```yaml
  service: light.turn_on
  target:
    entity_id: light.my_led_project_led
  ```

- To turn off the LED:

  ```yaml
  service: light.turn_off
  target:
    entity_id: light.my_led_project_led
  ```
